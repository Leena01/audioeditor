Determination of musical features for the creation of acoustic fingerprints

This was an experimental thesis project aimed at analyzing acoustic fingerprints with the use of basic signal processing methods. My main objective was to make an approximation of the keys and tones in a set of short piano pieces using Fourier analysis. After detecting the onsets in a piece, I classified them by comparing them with prerecorded sound files of singular piano notes. Then, by looking at the relative frequency of each class, I was able to make a rough estimate of the key.

The final product is a small audio editor and music player with a back-end written in Java SE and a front-end written in MATLAB. It incorporates code snippets from external sources, too - these are mentioned in the original documentation written in Hungarian. The prerecorded sound files were also taken from an online database of piano notes.
